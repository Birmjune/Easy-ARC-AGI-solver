How to train the model:

0. Install Requirements: Run this if the required Python packages are not yet installed.
 pip install -r ./artifacts/requirements.txt 

1. Edit train.py and ensure the path of train_dataset is actual dataset directory.
 e.g. for us, "/home/student/workspace/dataset"

2. Execute the following command to start training.
 python ./training_code/train.py

After training, the model will be saved to:
 artifacts/pretrained_models/Llama-3.1-8B-merged-2.

It is recommended to delete other intermediate folders such as:
 artifacts/pretrained_models/Llama-3.1-8B-merged-1
 artifacts/pretrained_models/Llama-3.1-8B-lora

Notes:
 The model for Final Evaluation (job ID: 1234) was trained with max_steps=3500.
 The model provided in this submission is further fine-tuned using num_train_epochs=2.
 For the cpu part, we tried to hard code the patterns for the given examples.
