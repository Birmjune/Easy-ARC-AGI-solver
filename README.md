# Easy-ARC-AGI-solver
This repo is a solver for easy ARC-AGI tasks, project for Basics of Deep Learning (SNU, 2025 Spring)

# How to train and test the model
Go to arc/training_code and follow the instructions in the README. To test the model, use the ARCSolver class in arc/arc.py. 

For the gencode directory used in CPU part (which is actually not used a lot in our code, just to save a tiny amount of time - you can just remove this part if you want), unzip the gencode_merged.zip file.
